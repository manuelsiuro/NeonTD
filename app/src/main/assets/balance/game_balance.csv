# Starting Gold Philosophy:
# - Tutorial (L1): Very high for experimentation
# - Easy (L2-4): Enough for 2-3 towers + upgrades
# - Medium (L5-10): Strategic placement required
# - Hard (L11-20): Economy management critical
# - Expert (L21-25): Tight economy
# - Extreme (L26-30): Maximum challenge

# ============================================================================
# BALANCE NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# Key Balance Principles:
# 1. Players should be able to place 2-3 towers before Wave 1
# 2. Economy should feel tight but not punishing on Normal
# 3. Boss kills should feel very rewarding (750g = 3-4 tower placements)
# 4. Late-game should require optimal tower placement and upgrades
# 5. No level should be impossible - all should be beatable with skill
#
# Tuning Tips:
# - If too easy: Reduce starting gold or increase difficulty_mult
# - If too hard: Increase enemy gold rewards or starting gold
# - If economy too slow: Increase wave bonus gold
# - If economy too fast: Reduce kill rewards
